This package overrides the load() and save() methods of HTTP::Cookies
so it can work with Mozilla cookie files.

It should be able to work with all Mozilla derived browsers.

This module can access the sqlite cookie jar either through
DBD::SQlite or using the sqlite3(1) interface.

In order to reduce dependencies, this package only depends on sqlite.
