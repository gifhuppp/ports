trurl is a tool in a similar spirit of tr but for URLs. Here, 'tr' stands for
translate or transpose.

It is designed to help shell script authors everywhere. URLs are tricky to
parse and there are numerous security problems in software because of this.
trurl wants to help soften this problem by taking away the need for script and
command line authors everywhere to re-invent the wheel over and over.
