COMMENT =	flashcard learning system with spaced repetition

#   
# Currently using 2.1.16, the last version before Anki started using Rust
# components.
#   
# In 2.1.35 the build was changed to use Bazel and requires java + python
# + node + rust (which is a pain but could be handled) and wants to
# download at build time (which is a non-starter for ports).
# Anyone looking at updating should take a look at FreeBSD who
# have managed to wrangle it into a shape which can be used there,
# but it is rather complicated. Discussion on AUR maybe useful too
# (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/anki), and see Anki's discussion
# in https://github.com/ankitects/anki/issues/1378
